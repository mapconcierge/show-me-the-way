### Filtering

#### By Bounding Box

You can restrict it to viewing only edits within a specified bounding-box like so:

https://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/#bounds=32.55,-15.82,71.65,44.65

* Japan: https://mapconcierge.github.io/show-me-the-way/#bounds=22.35008,122.08008,46.61926,151.43555

Build a bounding box URL like that, using this page:

#### By Changeset Comment

You can restrict it to viewing only edits where the changeset comment matches a string:

https://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/#comment=missingmaps

You can combine the filters using querystring notation:

https://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/#comment=missingmaps&bounds=32.55,-15.82,71.65,44.65
