### Filtering

#### By Bounding Box

https://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/#bounds=32.55,-15.82,71.65,44.65

* Japan

https://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/#bounds=25,125,50,150

Build a bounding box URL like that, using this page:

https://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/bbox.html

#### By Changeset Comment

You can restrict it to viewing only edits where the changeset comment matches a string:

https://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/#comment=missingmaps

You can combine the filters using querystring notation:

https://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/#comment=missingmaps&bounds=32.55,-15.82,71.65,44.65
